## 02. Overview <a name="02"></a>

We are going to cover how to create a restful api using node.js express and
mongodb together with mongoose.

Rest apis help us decouple our backend code from our front end so we can use it
across multiple application (mobile apps, web apps, etc).  We are going to
learn how to build a simple blog post type api with all the useful
methods(GET,POST,DELETE,PATCH).

We use Node.js as our backend language, express.js is going to help us create
routes easier and middlewares and we use mongodb together with mongoose to
create schemas and models that define how our data looks.

If you are a beginner with nodejs, express or mongodb I hope that this tutorial
will give you a good idea of how these technologies work well together.
